            <title>Terminating the terminal case of Linux</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a very calm and pleasant evening,
when, all of a sudden, Amos, known also as &lt;em&gt;fasterthanlime&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, published
an article entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fasterthanli.me&#x2F;articles&#x2F;a-terminal-case-of-linux&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;A terminal case of Linux&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. With a wonderfully punny title, he explains his adventure of getting colored terminal output out of a Linux process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ðŸ¤” I sure do envy Amos&#x27;s relationship with Cool Bear. I&#x27;d look into
getting such a sidekick myself, but the dorm I&#x27;m about to move into doesn&#x27;t
allow keeping pets, and definitely not ones sentient enough to throw a party.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a journey through the bowels of libc, the Land of Terrible Truths, and as
is in Amos&#x27;s style, many underlying details of the problem, we arrive at a
program that does what we&#x27;ve set out to do. Well, almost. </description>

            <title>Contextful exceptions with Forth metaprogramming</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 12:00:01 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;A typical Forth system provides a simple exception handling mechanism, in which
a single integer, that identifies the exception, is thrown. If we end up
catching the exception, this scheme works reasonably well. However, if it
bubbles up to the very top and gets printed to the user, we&#x27;d like to show a bit
more context. </description>

            <title>How Forth implements exceptions</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Considering Forth&#x27;s low-level nature, some might consider it surprising how
well-suited it is to handling exceptions. But indeed, ANS Forth does specify a
simple exception handling mechanism. As Forth doesn&#x27;t have a typesystem capable
of supporting a mechanism like Rust&#x27;s &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, exceptions are the preferred
error handling strategy. Let&#x27;s take a closer look at how they&#x27;re used, and how
they&#x27;re implemented.  </description>

            <title>Compiling Rust is NP-hard</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;...though it&#x27;s not the flagship borrow checking that&#x27;s at fault.  What I
noticed, and would like to share with you today, is that the exhaustiveness
checking performed by the Rust compiler on &lt;code&gt;match&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; patterns is a superset of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Boolean_satisfiability_problem&quot;&gt;SAT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; problem. </description>

            <title>Branches: No assembly required</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;niedzejkob.p4.team&#x2F;bootstrap&#x2F;branches&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Last time,&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; we started from the barebones &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;niedzejkob.p4.team&#x2F;bootstrap&#x2F;miniforth&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Miniforth kernel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and
implemented branches by writing additional primitive words in assembly. For
pragmatic reasons, that is the road I will be pursuing further, but I noticed
that it is also possible to implement branches in pure Forth. I believe that
this approach is quite interesting, so let&#x27;s take a detour and get a closer
look. </description>

            <title>No branches? No problem â€” a Forth assembler</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The set of words available after Miniforth boots is quite bare-bones. One
reader even &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Forth&#x2F;comments&#x2F;nxgg20&#x2F;fitting_a_forth_in_512_bytes&#x2F;h1eq4ok&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that, since there&#x27;s no branches, it is not
Turing-complete, and therefore not worthy of being called a Forth! Today is the
day we prove them wrong. </description>

            <title>Fitting a Forth in 512 bytes</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Software is full of circular dependencies if you look deep enough. Compilers
written in the language they compile are the most obvious example, but not the
only one. To compile a kernel, you need a running kernel. Linkers, build
systems, shells.  Even text editors, if you want to write the code instead of
just downloading it. How do you break this cycle? Since the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bootstrappable.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bootstrapping
problem&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has first come to my attention, I&#x27;ve been drawn to
this unique area of software engineering.  Not out of fear that someone would
try to implement a &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.ece.cmu.edu&#x2F;%7Eganger&#x2F;712.fall02&#x2F;papers&#x2F;p761-thompson.pdf&quot;&gt;trusting trust&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; attack, but simply as an interesting
challenge.  </description>
